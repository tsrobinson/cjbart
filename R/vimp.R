#' Estimate Variable Importance Metrics for \code{cjbart} Object
#' @description Estimates random forest variable importance scores for multiple attribute-levels of a conjoint experiment.
#' @param model Object of class \code{cjbart}, the result of running [cjbart::IMCE()]
#' @param outcomes An optional vector of attribute levels to generate importance metrics for. By default, all attribute-levels are analyzed.
#' @param covars An optional vector of covariates to include in the importance metric check. By default, all covariates are included in each importance model.
#' @return A long data.frame of variable importance scores for each covariate per attribute-level, as well as the estimated 95% confidence intervals for each score.
#' @details Having generated a schedule of individual-level marginal component effect estimates, for each attribute-level this function fits a random forest model using the supplied covariates as predictors. It then calculates a variable importance measure (VIMP) for each covariate. The VIMP assesses how important each covariate is in terms of partitioning the predicted individual-level effects distribution, and can thus be used as an indicator of where heterogeneity exists.
#' To recover our VIMP measure, we used permutation-based importance metrics recovered from random forest models (see [randomForestSRC::rfsrc()]. To permute the data, this function uses random node assignment where cases are randomly assigned to a daughter node whenever a tree splits on the target variable (see \insertCite{ishwaran2008random}{cjbart}). Importance is defined in terms of how this random assignment degrades the performance of the forest. Higher degradation indicates a variable is more important to the prediction.
#' Variance estimates for the importance measures are recovered using the delete-d jackknife estimator developed by \insertCite{ishwaran2019standard;textual}{cjbart} and implemented in \pkg{randomForestSRC} \insertCite{randomforestsrc}{cjbart}. The jackknife method has inherent bias correction properties, making it particularly effective for variable selection exercises such as in identifying drivers of heterogeneity.

#' Estimate a Single Variable Importance Metric for \code{cjbart} Object
#' @description Estimates random forest variable importance scores for a single attribute-level of a conjoint experiment. This function is for advanced use. Users should typically use the [cjbart::het_vimp()] function.
#' @param model Object of class \code{cjbart}, the result of running [cjbart::IMCE()]
#' @param outcome Character string detailing the covariate over which to analyze heterogeneous effects
#' @param covars An optional vector of covariates to include in the importance metric check. When \code{covars = NULL} (the default), all covariates are included in the importance model.
#' @return Data.frame of variable importance scores for each covariate in the model, as well as values for the estimated 95% confidence interval for each importance score.
